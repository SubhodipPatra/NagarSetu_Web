# NagarSetu_Web

**Nagar Setu** is a public grievance redressal platform that bridges the gap between citizens and administrative authorities.  
It enables **citizens** to raise complaints, **officers** to address them, and **admins** to oversee the process — all secured with **JWT authentication** and automated complaint routing.

##  Automated Complaint Routing
Nagar Setu uses a **DSA-based routing algorithm**:
1. Each complaint has a **type** (e.g., Development, Sanitation).
2. Based on the type → routed to the corresponding **department**.
3. Within that department → complaint goes to the **officer serving the given location**.
4. Officer gets notified instantly.

Example:
- Complaint: "Streetlight not working" → Category: Development → Department: BDO → Officer at pincode `713101`.
